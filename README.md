John Romero  
Biography of a Key Software Engineer
Intro

John Romero grew up in the desert of Tucson, Arizona. To quote the man himself: “while my family is known for programming and design, it has also known tremendous amounts of 
success in dealing drugs and drinking vast amounts of alcohol.” This history even led to the death of 3 family members. Due to this upbringing, games and technology were
not a part of Romero’s life growing up. That was until in 1976 when he found a pong console on a black and white tv in his grandmother’s house. Romero who was 8 years old 
at the time says he was mesmerized to see something he controlled, move on the TV Screen. Not long after, his parents divorced and he moved to California, home to many of 
the pivotal companies at the beginning of the games industry.

A few years later, in the Summer of 1979, Romero had perhaps the most formative event in the development of his interest in computer game development. His brother and his 
friend Robert had rushed home to tell him about how they had found a place to play games for free! They quickly headed off on their bikes and 45 minutes later, found themselves 
at the computer science department in Sierra College where Robert introduced John to countless games. The 3 would return to the college almost every day that Summer. 
Slowly, Romero started to take notice of what the students in these labs were up to. He would ask them questions about what they were doing and eventually, he would try doing 
some programming himself. The following year, Sierra College opened an Apple 2 lab which Romero frequented for many years thereafter to expand his coding knowledge base and to 
work on more games.

In 1980, Romero, now 12, started frequenting arcades during the peak of the arcade industry. New games were being released on a weekly basis with tons of innovation and new 
ideas being introduced constantly. In 1982, Romero finally received his first PC, an Apple 2 and for the next 5 years he spent every spare hour of his time programming, 
especially during the summer where he would go from 8am to midnight, just programming. Romero had written 51 games by 1987, most of which he published.

In 1987, Romero secured his first industry job at Origin Systems. Then, in 1989, Romero alongside his friend Lane Roathe founded Ideas from the Deep or as it’s more commonly 
known, id Software. This is the company where Romero would go on to change the video game industry forever.

When id started, 8-bit games were dying and being very rapidly replaced by their superior, 16-bit counterparts. It was a dramatic shift in the industry but id were more than 
capable of this and were soon in talks with Nintendo about a PC port of Super Mario Bros. 3. Nintendo, wanting to keep their games to their own consoles, refused but that work
was not lost and went on to be the foundation of their first game, Commander Keen which has since been dubbed by PC Gamer as one of the 50 most important PC Games of all time. 
This game changed id from an industry participant to a leader with its groundbreaking smooth scrolling. Romero and others at id were able to quit their jobs and commit to 
working full time at id.

The group continued making games and developing better engines for their games. They were pioneers in engine design, starting the trend of selling off game engines for other 
developers to make new games from. Engine licensing such as this is seen as commonplace in the industry today with big engines such as the Unity and Unreal Engines.

It wasn’t long before id created Wolfenstein 3D, the grandfather of all first person shooters. This game defined what the shooter genre would become and laid the groundwork 
for a genre that is still thriving to this day. So many of the things we take for granted in shooters and games as a whole today were either introduced in or popularised by 
Wolfenstein. While some more basic first person games had already existed prior to Wolfenstein’s release, Wolfenstein was much much different, featuring the now standard UI 
of the gun in front of the camera that could be reloaded and fired and alternated between. It featured combat built around spatial control and enabling the players to make 
clever use of the games architecture to benefit them in combat. It also quickly became the most popular shareware game of all time, popularising the concept greatly. 
Shareware was a method of game distribution online which was the predecessor to services such as Steam today. Wolfenstein was also the world's first major look at modding 
and a community quickly developed around it but more on that later. Finally, while not specifically developments, Wolfenstein is the reason we have so many of gaming's most 
iconic tropes to this day whether it be shooting nazis, the strong man, non family friendly protagonist, killing zombies and of course most importantly, the weapons. 
Whether it be the close range melee weapon, a sub par pistol, the sporadic chain gun, the rocket launcher and even the flame thrower. Finally, the sheer amount of blood and
violence that had never been seen before in a first person game.

Now hugely successful, with Wolfenstein 3D selling fast across the globe, Romero and the rest of id began planning their next title, Doom. Already confident in all they were 
planning they put out a press release announcing Doom, describing it as the next technological revolution in pc gaming before they had even begun development. As you know 
however, they were very right to be as confident as they were. Doom is to this day cited as the most important and greatest video games of all time. What Wolfenstein 3D 
innovated, it perfected and then did so much more. Another thing of note from this press release, is that id promised Doom would be an open game. This meant the game was 
designed to be easily accessible to the modding community and they even promised to provide things such as file formats and technical notes to anyone who wanted them. 
Id also promised that “In 1993, we fully expect to be the number one cause of decreased productivity in businesses around the world.”

Doom was released on December 10 of 1993. Gaming was never the same again. Doom innovated the industry in innumerable ways. The deathmatch mode was the world's first experience 
with a truly fast multiplayer game. This new type of gameplay amongst different players has since grown to probably the most popular genre of gaming today. The new engine, 
utilising 3D graphics enabled all new game design never seen before. No longer were maps only flat walls and constant floors at right angles. Maps could now be at any angle 
or height developers wished leading to some of the most groundbreaking and cutting edge level design of all time. Lighting was calculated based on distance from the light 
source, the concept of distant objects becoming less visible was implemented, things like teleporters, moving platforms, switches and movable stairs were all programmed in my 
Romero. The game was also the first game to effectively make use of texture mapping to upload art directly onto surfaces in game giving the game a much greater sense of realism 
and beauty than any first person game before it.

The mod scene thrived and the gameplay was unlike anything people had seen before. The game was designed in such a way that the engine code was kept separate to the data files, 
called WAD files (Where’s All the Data). This meant modders could easily manipulate and add things to the game without damaging the engine of the game. 

Id gave copies of the game out for free to stores so retailers made 100% of profits which led the game somehow becoming exponentially more popular. True to their word, Doom was 
indeed a source of controversy in many workplaces and was banned during work hours at many leading tech companies such as Intel. 

However, Romero and the others at Id were not done innovating the shooter genre just yet. They began work on Quake which was yet another leap in technology for Gaming as a 
whole. The game was completely in 3D, something never seen before. While previous titles, most notably Doom, had made use of 3D graphics, Quake was the first to be made 
entirely in 3D using polygonal models rather than pre rendered sprites, in a time without 3D model creation software or GPUs. This would of course become the standard for
all 3D game design moving forward. It also introduced to the world, online multiplayer. Previously, players would need to use LAN connections to play with others on their 
local network but now players could connect across the globe through the internet. This development needs no explanation as to how important it was for the gaming industry as 
a whole. Finally it introduced the concept of mouse look, or in other words, letter players direct the camera with the position of their mouse. This feature is standard for all 
shooters today.

Unfortunately, the 18 month development of Quake was tough and led to lots of conflict within the company. Romero made the decision to leave the company in January 1996. After 
7 more months of working on crunch mode, Romero, by himself, uploaded Quake on a Saturday. He finally left on August 6th and began a new company, Ion Storm with his friend Tom 
Hall. He made no money off the success of Quake. Quake was the final pillar in the development of the shooter genre. From it spawned all online shooter culture. From esports, 
to clans it marked the beginning of the reign of the shooters that continues to this day.

From here, Romero continued making games under different companies of various genres. Notably he created Deus Ex with Ion Storm, an innovative mix of 4 gaming genres, First 
person shooters, adventure, role playing and immersive simulation (incorporating player choice). He then went on to form Monkeystone Games, again with Hall, which began work 
on mobile games 5 whole years before the release of the iphone. He began working at Gazillion to develop an MMORPG which never released before leaving to work with a small team
on a facebook game named Ravenwood Fair with other 25 million players within the space of six months. Following this success and seeing the value in such games he co founded 
a company called Lootdrop with his now wife, Brenda Romero. Finally, after the social game bubble burst, John and Brenda moved to Ireland where they founded Romero Games where 
he works to this day.
